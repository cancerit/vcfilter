  vcfilter filter [OPTIONS...] [FILTER_CONFIG] [VCF...] - v1.0.4

 Given one or more VCF files, filter on the expression provided by FILTER_CONFIG file.
 User-friendly wrapper around bcftools filter - for more advanced filtering needs go direct!

 OPTIONS

            -e  filter exclusively, i.e. exclude items that match FILTER_CONFIG
            
            -i  filter inclusively, i.e. include only items that match FILTER_CONFIG
            
            -f [STRING]  append string to VCF/s to be filtered. May only contain alphanumerics, "." and "_". Defaults to 'filter'
            
            -h, help  show help
            
            -o [PATH]  output directory. Defaults to current directory
           
            -q  suppress messages
            
            -s [STRING]  soft filter. Instead of excluding/including entries which do not satisfy expression, change their FILTER flags to [STRING]
            
FILTER_CONFIG
            
            This file should contain a bcftools logical expression on a single line, and in single quotes, e.g.: 'CLPM=0 & DP>10'.
            The filter will then attempt to filter the provided VCFs by this logic, presuming the tokens used are present in the VCF header.
            For help on constructing appropriate filtering expressions see https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/howtos/filtering.html, or man bcftools.
            To see available filterables for a given VCF, use vcfilter get.
